# Disentangled Multi-Modal Music Genre Clustering

This repository contains the implementation of unsupervised music genre clustering
using Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Beta-VAE, and multi-modal fusion of
audio and lyrics.

## Tasks Implemented
- Easy: VAE + KMeans clustering
- Medium: Multi-modal fusion (audio + lyrics)
- Hard: Beta-VAE / CVAE with disentangled representations

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Bangla and English songs organized by genre.
Due to copyright restrictions, raw audio files are not included.

## How to Run
```bash
python main_easy.py
python main_medium.py
python main_hard.py
